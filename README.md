This is my Microwave Oven project, written in C programming language, developed during the Embedded System Internship at Emertxe Information Technology.
Project was created using PIC microcontroller PIC16F877A, having the purpose of performing the usual daily actions of a microwave oven.

Installation:
-	Install MPLAB X IDE, the XC8 compiler
-	Install PICSimLab used for coding and simulation
  
Usage:
PICSimLab will replicate the behavior of an embedded controller in a microwave oven.
Feel free to explore how the project works and how microwave oven can be simulated by watching the below link:
